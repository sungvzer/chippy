# Chipquarium
A CHIP-8 fish tank simulator.

Your mission is to keep your pet fish alive as long as possible. To do so, you
will need to:
* Make sure the tank is kept clean.
* Make sure your fish never too hungry.
* Make sure your fish is happy.

If your fish is healthy and happy enough, he will eventually grow larger. But be
sure your fish gets enough sleep! He will refuse to eat and play if he is too
tired.

Chipquarium was programmed using [Octo][1] assembly language as part of
[Octo-ber Jam III][2].
